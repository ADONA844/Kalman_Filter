# Kalman Filter Project
This project implements a Kalman Filter, an advanced algorithm that provides efficient and accurate state estimation for dynamic systems using a series of incomplete and noisy measurements. The Kalman Filter is a powerful tool widely used in various fields, including robotics, navigation, control systems, and signal processing. It offers robust capabilities for real-time applications by predicting the state of a system and updating the estimates based on new measurements. This implementation includes support for both linear and extended Kalman Filters, making it adaptable to both linear and non-linear systems. The project aims to provide an easy-to-integrate solution that can be seamlessly incorporated into existing projects, enhancing their ability to handle uncertainty and noise in measurements. With detailed documentation and examples, this Kalman Filter implementation serves as a valuable resource for engineers, researchers, and developers looking to leverage the power of Kalman Filtering in their applications.
